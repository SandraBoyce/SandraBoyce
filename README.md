Hi, I'm @SandraBoyce!

I'm a software developer.

I am looking to help small businesses make their internet debut or update their current website.

My current personal project is called "Daily Do Its" where I aim to:
1. Provide a nudge that changes you from an object at rest to an object in motion so you can get things done.
2. Reinforce a baseline muscle memory needed for coding, drawing, and hopefully more.
